# Frontend rebuild after changes

- When changing the web interface code (files in `frontend/src/`), **always** rebuild the frontend.
- Use the command:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

- Run the build after significant changes and before starting or restarting the backend so that `frontend/dist` contains an up-to-date bundle.
