# Python Quality Checks

When editing or creating Python files in this project:

1. **After changes**: Run `mypy src/ tests/`, `flake8 src/ tests/`, and `pytest` to verify quality.
2. **Fix issues**: Resolve any mypy type errors, flake8 lint violations, or failing tests before considering the task complete.
3. **Scope**: Run checks on `src/` and `tests/` directories.
